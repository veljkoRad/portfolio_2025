# Single Page Aplication

* SPA loads one html file (`index.html`) and then javascript(react) renders pages client-side without doing full page reload

* SPA: 
  *  public/index.html (or similar) and React mounts into a `<div id="root">`.
  
  *  React Router (optional, but common).

  * When you navigate, the URL changes but the browser doesn’t do a full refresh.
