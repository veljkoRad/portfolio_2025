# Navbar

### What happens?
- I'm defining mui component AppBar where I have contained toolbar which includes Logo image,  stack of desktop-nav-buttons, light/dark button,mobile-menu-button

### AppBar
- **AppBar** is background of Navbar. **Toolbar** is for content size and position in AppBar. **Container** so we can add dynamic maxWidth ('xl').
